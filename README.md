# Power-Grid Frequency

Power-grid frequency data from around the world, cleaned and processed for research usage.

The data is collected from the TSO's and is processed to remove dead recordings, spikes, and other naturally assumed bad measurements. The scripts that are used to clean the data are also included, for transparency.

# European Grids

The available recordings from Europe are of the following synchronous regions

 - Continental Europe:
   - Germany [1 sec recordings] - [TransnetBW](https://www.transnetbw.com/en/energy-market/ancillary-services/control-reserve-demand-activation)
   - Germany [1 sec recordings] - [50hertz](https://www.50hertz.com/de/) - currently not working
   - France [10 sec recordings]- [RTE](https://clients.rte-france.com/lang/an/visiteurs/vie/vie_frequence.jsp)

 - Nordic Grid:
   - Finland [0.1 sec recordings] - [FinGrid](https://data.fingrid.fi/en/dataset/frequency-historical-data)

 - Great Britain:
   - England [1 sec recordings] - [NationalGrid ESO](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/balancing-services/frequency-response-services/historic-frequency-data)
