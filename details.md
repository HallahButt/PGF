## Power-grid frequency database

Welcome to the website of the Power-grid frequency database. Here you can find recordings of power-grid freuquency from across the globe.

This website is the front-end of the data repository in [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/m43tg/). The website [Power-Grid frequency database](https://lrydin.github.io/Power-Grid-Frequency/) contains all the relevant information on the content of this database.

This database of power-grid frequency is comprised of open data existent across three dimensions:
 - TSO data: Transmission System's Operator (TSO) recordings made public;
 - Research projects: Open-data database research projects;
 - Independent Gatherings: Industrial, private, or personal recordings that were made publicly available.

The data found here is always free for usage. For each dataset you should check their licensing, to ensure no copyright violations and correct referencing. The data from the *TSOs* and *Independent Gatherings* is processed, using a set of scripts found Power-Grid [Power-Grid Frequency](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency/scripts). The data from other research projects is simply linked here, added to the map, and structured into the [database](/database). If you wish to add your data, contact us or open an issue on the Github repository [Power-Grid Frequency](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency).

This is not a static database, we need everyone to contribute their data to ensure transparent and clean science. The data we process and make available is hosted on Open Science Framework.
