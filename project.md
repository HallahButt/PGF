Project's aim, its history, funding, and people involved.

## Scientific Aim
The aim of this project is to collect the growing data in power-grid systems, in particular, in power-grid frequency recordings. These recordings are of immense value for the scientific community, as they carry relevant information of a power-grid stability and dynamics.
In this database we collect open-data power-grid frequency recordings from all around the world.
We preprocess the data and make it available, formatted for scientific studies.

### Collaboration
Data should be open. Science should be transparent. We accept contributions from all parties, private or personal, if those naturally have the same interest at heart: sharing the data openly. We review the data ourselves and, if needed, process it using our scripts, to ensure a uniform structure oriented for research usage. This means the data is saved in `.csv` files, which can be read in any platform, and is compressed in `.zip` format to considerably reduce overhead and making easy to download.
If you wish to contribute, open an issue on the GitHub repository [Power-Grid-Frequency-Data](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency-Data), and together we add the data, convert it into the desired format, report on the relevant information, and upload it to the repository.

## The project
### History

This project started in 2018 as a collaboration between Leonardo Rydin Gorjão and Benjamin Schäfer to extent the accessibility of data in research in power-grid systems. Richard Jumar and Heiko Maaß, from the [Karlsruhe Institute for Technology ─ Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php), have developed a recording apparatus, the EDR, Electrical Data Recorder, similar in nature to a phase-monitor unit, and in a collaborative manner we set out to record power-grid frequency across twelve independent regions.
This project, and our general pursuit, is to further collaborations in the research community─between all field, engineering, physics, mathematics, etc.─by advocating a more transparent and open-access policy of data.

### People
This project as seen input over the years from many people. We are grateful to everyone who as collaborated with us, in one way of another: Mehrnaz Anvari, Philipp Böttcher, Galib Hassan, Christian Beck, Marc Timme, Dirk Witthaut, Johannes Kruse, Raphael Biertz, Holger Kantz, Veit Hagenmeyer, Damià Gomila, Malte Schröder, Jan Wohland, Cigdem Yalcin, Filipe Pereira, André Frazão, Kaur Tuttelberg, Jako Kilter, Hauke Hähne, and Bálint Hartmann.

### Website and repositories
Associated with this project are two main online repositories: the data are either stored or linked in the GitHub repository [Power-Grid-Frequency-Data](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency-Data) and the website is stored in the GitHub repository [Power-Grid-Frequency](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency). This allows the users to clone the GitHub data without also having to get all the data for the website. Data already existent in open-data frames, e.g. Open Science Data, is linked in the [Power-Grid-Frequency-Data](https://github.com/LRydin/Power-Grid-Frequency-Data) GitHub repository.
This website was build by Leonardo Rydin Gorjão and Galib Hassan.
