Project's aim, its history, funding, and people involved.

## Scientific Aim
The aim of this project is to collect the growing data in power-grid systems, in particular, in power-grid frequency recordings. These recordings are of immense value for the scientific community, as they carry relevant information of a power-grid stability and dynamics.
In this database we collect open-data power-grid frequency recordings from all around the world.
We preprocess the data and make it available, formatted for scientific studies.

## The project
### History

This project started in 2018 as a collaboration between Leonardo Rydin Gorjão and Benjamin Schäfer to extent the accessibility of data in research in power-grid systems. Richard Jumar and Heiko Maaß, from the [Karlsruhe Institute for Technology ─ Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php), have developed a recording apparatus, the EDR, Electrical Data Recorder, similar in nature to a phase-monitor unit, and in a collaborative manner we set out to record power-grid frequency across twelve independent regions.
This project, and our general pursuit, is to further collaborations in the research community─between all field, engineering, physics, mathematics, etc.─by advocating a more transparent and open-access policy of data.

### People
This project as seen input over the years from many people. We are grateful to everyone who as collaborated with us, in one way of another: Mehrnaz Anvari, Philipp Böttcher, Christian Beck, Marc Timme, Dirk Witthaut, Johannes Kruse, Raphael Biertz, Holger Kantz, Veit Hagenmeyer, Damià Gomila, Malte Schröder, Jan Wohland, Cigdem Yalcin, Filipe Pereira, André Frazão, Kaur Tuttelberg, Jako Kilter, Hauke Hähne, and Bálint Hartmann.
