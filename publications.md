A collection of power-grid-frequency related articles can be found here. We report on the main articles that brought about the creation of this power-grid frequency database, as well as a collection of other related research publications and websites.

> The transformation of the electrical energy system due to the increasing infeed from renewable energy sources has attracted much attention in diverse research communities. Novel approaches for grid control, grid modeling, and grid architectures are widely proposed. However, data from actual power system operation are rarely available but are critically necessary to analyze real-world scenarios or to evaluate models. In the present paper, we introduce a precisely time-stamped data set comprising power grid frequency measurements from twelve independent synchronous areas of different sizes in one-second resolution. Furthermore, the data includes a synchronized measurement of the frequency within the Continental European synchronous area with measurement points in Portugal, Germany, and Turkey, maximizing the geographical span. Finally, we provide excerpts of the underlying raw data. Data were collected using a self-developed Phasor-Measurement-Unit(PMU)-like device, the Electrical Data Recorder (EDR), connected mostly to conventional low-voltage power outlets.

>The electrical energy system has attracted much attention from an increasingly diverse research community. Many theoretical predictions have been made, from scaling laws of fluctuations to propagation velocities of disturbances. However, to validate any theory, empirical data from large-scale power systems are necessary but are rarely shared openly. Here, we analyse an open data base of measurements of electric power grid frequencies across 17 locations in 12 synchronous areas on three continents. The power grid frequency is of particular interest, as it indicates the balance of supply and demand and carries information on deterministic, stochastic, and control influences. We perform a broad analysis of the recorded data, compare different synchronous areas and validate a previously conjectured scaling law. Furthermore, we show how fluctuations change from local independent oscillations to a homogeneous bulk behaviour. Overall, the presented open data base and analyses may constitute a step towards more shared, collaborative energy research.

>The energy system is rapidly changing to accommodate the increasing number of renewable generators and the general transition towards a more sustainable future. Simultaneously, business models and market designs evolve, affecting power-grid operation and power-grid frequency. Problems raised by this ongoing transition are increasingly addressed by transdisciplinary research approaches, ranging from purely mathematical modelling to applied case studies. These approaches require a stochastic description of consumer behaviour, fluctuations by renewables, market rules, and how they influence the stability of the power-grid frequency. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use, data-driven, stochastic model for the power-grid frequency and demonstrate how it reproduces key characteristics of the observed statistics of the Continental European and British power grids. Using data analysis tools and a Fokker-Planck approach, we estimate parameters of our deterministic and stochastic model. We offer executable code and guidelines on how to use the model on any power grid for various mathematical or engineering applications.

>The frequency constitutes a key state variable of electrical power grids. However, as the frequency is subject to several sources of fluctuations, ranging from renewable volatility to demand fluctuations and dispatch, it is strongly dynamic. Yet, the statistical and stochastic properties of the frequency fluctuation dynamics are far from fully understood. Here, we analyse properties of power grid frequency trajectories recorded from different synchronous regions. We highlight the non-Gaussian and still approximately Markovian nature of the frequency statistics. Further, we find that the frequency displays significant fluctuations exactly at the time intervals of regulation and trading, confirming the need of having a regulatory and market design that respects the technical and dynamical constraints in future highly renewable power grids. Finally, employing a recently proposed synthetic model for the frequency dynamics, we combine our statistical and stochastic analysis and analyse in how far dynamically modelled frequency properties match the ones of real trajectories.
